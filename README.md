This is a generator for using Mithril with Meteor.    
It replaces Blaze with Mithril, sets up basic Mithril routing and creates a shared functions helper file.

Recently updated for Meteor 1.3.2
This has also recently been updated to include bootstrap css as well as a demo of user sign-in sign-up. 
There is also a new route which shows search result mapping from both the local Mongo db and from an external API.
You will need to run: npm i generator-meteor-mithril
This will add the template for the generator.
Then make sure you have yeoman setup.

npm install yeoman-generator

npm install -g yo

npm i generator-meteor-mithril

yo meteor-mithril
